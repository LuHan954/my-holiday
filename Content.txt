1.On 4th Oct 2020, I went to Kuala Lumpur with my classmates from Telebort. Our instructors from Telebort gave us some missions and we will need to accomplish the missions. We need to take photos of our favourite places and sceneries, and come out with some creative poses in the photos! I really enjoy the trip with my classmates in this outing. I have seen and learned about different places. I love Kuala Lumpur and i hope we will have another outing again in the future.
2.The most incredible place in Kuala Lumpur is the twin tower. It was build to attract the visitors from the other country and others. It is also the most tallest building in the world.
